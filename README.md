Leverage the wealth of data accumulated over years using Runkeeper to assess my running performance.
Extract key trends, identify areas for improvement, and potentially set more targeted running goals.
Analysis of the Project:
In this project, the "problem" I aimed to address was the absence of a comprehensive analysis of my 
running data. While I had been diligently tracking runs with Runkeeper, the data remained largely unanalysed.
I lacked insights into key aspects like:
Overall training volume trends (distance covered over time)
Pace and speed variations and their connection to factors like distance or elevation
Consistency in training frequency and how it might impact performance
Identification of personal bests or longest runs

This lack of deeper understanding made it difficult to:
Set targeted running goals based on my current performance level
Identify areas for improvement in my training regimen
